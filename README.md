### Hi there 👋

As a Computer Science graduate from Nusa Mandiri University with one year of experience in backend engineering, I have developed a strong foundation in software engineering, cloud computing, and system design. I'm currently learning about cloud computing and system design. With hard and soft skills, I have learned, used, and polished over the last few years, I would like to pursue and deep dive even further as a software engineer.
